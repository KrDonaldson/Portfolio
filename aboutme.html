                    <h4>Where it began:</h4>
                    <p>
                        As the second oldest of nine children in a split family growing up in the western United States, my beginnings were colorful to say the least. Being born into an underclass family, 
                        who worked up to being working poor, heavily influenced my view of basic necessities such as food, water, housing, and education. My childhood was pivotal in establishing my determination 
                        to acquire vast amounts of knowledge as well as my deep understanding that my <strong>greatest</strong> desire is to help others and make the world a better place for all of its inhabitants.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I took advantage of every opportunity I had available to me. I excelled at school and was a voracious reader. In addition to reading my weakness (young adult 
                        fantasy novels), any time not spent taking care of my siblings was spent reading, studying, and learning as much as I could. Mathematics, chemistry, physics, literature, history, sociology, 
                        herbology, astronomy, I wanted to know about all of it. Each topic pulling me in.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How it's going:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I've worked various positions in support roles and have moved towards technical support in recent years. Helping others, assisting in making their lives easier or better, even in the 
                        everyday small moments, is so fulfilling. 

                        <br> <br>

                        I am still learning and searching for ways to help others and the world. While my worldview has grown significantly since my childhood, my desire to help make the world 
                        better has become more resolute. Through college I put my focus on my natural talent for mathematics and computer science. I realized logic and technology 
                        will be key instruments in finding solutions for most problems that arise. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        I continue growing my knowledge around programming, focusing on full stack development, apps, webpages. Most recently my focus has been Python and Data Science.

                    <h4>Where it's going:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, my goal is to obtain financial freedom while working with companies and groups on projects that benefit our planet or enable beings, big and small, to live happy, fulfilling lives.
